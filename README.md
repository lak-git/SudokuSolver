# Sudoku Solver

## Overview
This project lets you input any 9×9 Sudoku puzzle and solves it in real time using a classic backtracking algorithm. Click on any cell to select it, enter numbers using the on‑screen keypad, then hit **“Solve Sudoku”**—the solver will fill in the rest of the board. If no valid solution exists, you’ll be notified immediately.
